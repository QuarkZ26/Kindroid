Kindroid Clear Chatbox when Using Wizard

This userscript enhances the Kindroid chat UI by automatically clearing the chatbox before triggering the “Suggest message” button — ensuring no leftover text interferes with the assistant's suggestion.
✨ Features

    ✅ Auto-clears the chatbox before triggering the "Suggest message" button.

    🧠 Bypass clearing with a long-press (≥600ms hold) — just click Suggest without clearing.

    🕵️ Invisible overlay button ensures compatibility with Kindroid’s layout.

    ♻️ Self-healing overlay tracks layout changes or re-rendering.

    🛡️ Handles React-controlled inputs safely via native setter and input events.

This ensures you can either:

    Tap → Clear & Suggest (default).

    Hold → Suggest without clearing (e.g., retrying or adjusting a previous prompt, or starting your own prompt and have the wizard add to it).
