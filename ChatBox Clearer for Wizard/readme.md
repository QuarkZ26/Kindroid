# Kindroid Chatbox Cleaner + Smart Suggest Trigger

A [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) userscript for [Kindroid.ai](https://kindroid.ai/) that **clears the text area before generating suggestions**, preventing stale or unintended prompts — while still allowing **long-press bypass**.

---

## Features

- **Auto-clears** the chatbox before triggering the “Suggest message” button  
- **Bypasses React control** using native input setters (React-safe)  
- **Long-press detection** (≥600ms) lets you *skip clearing* if needed  

---

## Usage

1. Install the script via the link below
2. Press the wizard button to generate a brand new suggestion, or long press to keep what's in the box and have the wizard add onto it.
