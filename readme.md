Kindroid Helper Scripts (Violentmonkey)

This repository contains a collection of Violentmonkey user scripts designed to enhance and automate interactions with Kindroid, a popular Android app mirroring and control interface.
✨ Features

These scripts aim to streamline your workflow by automating tedious or repetitive actions within the Kindroid web interface. Examples include:

    ✅ Auto-clicking "cut-off message" or "view full message" buttons

    🔁 Persistent automation through page switches (single-page app support)

    ⚙️ Configurable script behavior via in-page UI

    🔒 Domain-safe execution — only runs where it's supposed to
