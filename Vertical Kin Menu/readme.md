# 👥 CloneKinsToTheSide – Persistent Avatar Switcher for Kindroid

A [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) userscript for [Kindroid.ai](https://kindroid.ai/) that **clones all visible avatars (“kins”) into a fixed vertical stack** on the right edge — always accessible, even when the main avatar bar disappears.

Faster switching, fewer clicks, no hassle.

---

## Features

- Creates a **right-edge vertical stack** of all current avatars
- Each clone button mirrors the original — click to trigger avatar switch
- Auto-syncs when avatars appear or change (SPA-aware)
- On pages without the avatar bar (e.g. group chat), displays a **“Go Back”** floating button
- Zero config — works instantly on install

## Usage

1. Install the script via the link below
2. Reload or navigate within Kindroid
3. The fixed right-edge avatar stack will appear automatically
4. Click any avatar to switch — just like the originals. Works also on selfies page, for example you can click the request selfie button or click the regenerate button and switch Kin while keeping everything open (equivalent to the little pin button at the top)

No menus or settings required — just plug and play.

## Notes

Groups will not show the icon the same way the actual menu does, it will only show the first Kin's avatar. Groups are also different in that they go to a different page than Home. At that point the only thing you can do is go back so it will only show a Back button, this still avoids you having to move the mouse all the way back to the left side.
